# Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

## Objective
Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer based on demographic and financial data.

## Approach
1. **Data Loading & Encoding**: Loaded the Bank Marketing Dataset and encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored key features like age, balance, and job type; visualized target distribution to understand customer behavior.  
3. **Model Training**: Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers to predict loan acceptance.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess performance.  

## Results & Insights
- Customers with higher balances and more previous campaign contacts are more likely to accept the loan.  
- Age, balance, and previous contacts are among the most influential features.  
- Both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree achieved strong prediction performance, helping banks target likely prospects effectively.
