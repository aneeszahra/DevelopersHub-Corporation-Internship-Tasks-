# Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

## Objective
Estimate the medical insurance claim amount based on personal data, such as age, BMI, and smoking status.

## Approach
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Loaded the Medical Cost Personal Dataset and ensured all missing values were handled.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized how BMI, age, and smoking status impact insurance charges using histograms and boxplots.  
3. **Model Training**: Trained a Linear Regression model to predict insurance charges.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results & Insights
- Smoking status significantly increases insurance charges.  
- Higher BMI and older age also lead to higher insurance claims.  
- Linear Regression provides a reliable estimate of insurance charges for individual policyholders, helping insurance companies with pricing strategies.
